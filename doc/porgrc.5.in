.SH NAME
porgrc - configuration file for porg
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB@sysconfdir@/porgrc\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBporgrc\fR is the system-wide configuration file for \fBporg(8)\fR,
the source code package organizer.
.SH SYNTAX
.PP
The file consists of comments and key-value pairs. Comments are on separate
lines that start with a \fB#\fR symbol. The key-value pairs are on the form:
.PP
\fBkey=value\fR
.PP
where \fBkey\fR contains no whitespace and no equal signs, and
\fBvalue\fR will be all of the text after the equal sign until (but not
including) the ending newline.
.PP
The name of \fBkey\fR is case insensitive (e.g. \fBINCLUDE\fR, \fBinclude\fR 
and \fBINcludE\fR are equivalent).
.SH OPTIONS
The following options can be set. The equivalent command line options (if any),
are listed in brackets:
.TP
\fBlogdir\fR [-L|--logdir]
.br
Base porg logs directory. Default is '@LOGDIR@'. Environment variables like
$HOME are expanded at runtime.
.TP
\fBinclude\fR [-I|--include]
.br
Colon-separated list of paths to scan when logging the installation of a
package. Default is '/'.
.br
Shell wildcards are allowed in the paths. See \fIPATH MATCHING\fR below for
more details.
.TP
\fBexclude\fR [-E|--exclude]
.br
Colon-separated list of paths to skip when logging the installation of a
package. Default is '@EXCLUDE@'.
.br
Shell wildcards are allowed in the paths. See \fIPATH MATCHING\fR below for
more details.
.TP
\fBremove_skip\fR [-e|--skip]
.br
Colon-separated list of paths to skip when removing a
package. Default is '' (all logged files are removed).
.br
Shell wildcards are allowed in the paths. See \fIPATH MATCHING\fR below for
more details.
.SH PATH MATCHING
Variables \fB\include\fR, \fBexclude\fR and \fBremove_skip\fR accept a 
colon-separated list of
paths, each of which may contain shell-like wildcards (*, ? and [..]).
Files are matched against each of those paths, following the standard
shell-like expansion, but with the following exception: If a path in the list
does not contain any wildcard, and it is a directory, it matches any file
within that directory.
