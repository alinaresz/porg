Q1: When building LFS, porg does not properly log the installation of glibc
    in chapter 6 (some files are not logged)

R1: This is because in the chapter 6 some of glibc files are installed
	using statically linked sln. To have a proper glibc log you can run the
	following in chroot after installing glibc:

		find /lib -type l | while read name
		do
			if [ "$(porg -f glibc | grep "$(readlink $name)")" != "" ]
			then
				echo $name
			fi
		done | porg -lp+ glibc-<GLIBC_VERSION>

	Or the following simpler command, if you run it right after installing
	glibc, and before installing any other package:
        
		find /lib | porg -lp+ glibc-<GLIBC_VERSION>


Q2: Is it safe to launch porg with sudo?

R2: Yes. Here you can see a thread in the paco mailing list that discusses this
    issue:

Q3: Is it safe to launch sudo with porg?

R3: No. For example the command:

        porg -lp foobar-1.0 "sudo make install"

    would not produce any error message, and the package would be actually
    installed, but porg would not be able to monitor the installation and no
    files would be logged.
    This is due to LD_PRELOAD limitations on suid programs like sudo.
