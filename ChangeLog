Version 0.10 (17 May 2016)
--------------------------

	+ Fixed bug: Make variable names in porgrc file really case 
	  insensitive. Now, "LOGDIR", "logdir" and "LogDiR" are all
	  valid and equivalent (thanks Alain Bureau).


Version 0.9 (16 April 2016)
---------------------------

	General changes:

	+ Removed 'make logme' (no longer required to log the own porg 
	  installation). Experimental. Please report any error.
	+ Removed /mnt, /media and /cdrom from the default EXCLUDE (thanks
	  Tomoaki Nishiyama).
	+ Replace mode_t by int when calling va_arg() so that the code compiles
	  in OSX 10.6 (thanks Tomoaki Nishiyama).
	+ Allow lowercase variable names in porgrc (like 'include=...').

	Changes in grop:

	+ Bugfix: When running grop as root, save config file in directory
	  '/root/.config/grop' (it was saved in the ordinary user home dir).

	+ Fixed "double DESTDIR" bug (thanks Rene J.V. Bertin).
	+ Added support for MacOS, and perhaps MacOS X (thanks Masahiro Kasahara
	  and Rene J.V. Bertin).

	Changes in porg:

	+ Better option requirement checking.
	+ When calculating total sizes of packages, sizes of hardlinks to installed
	  files are counted only once (thanks Kardakov Slava).

	Changes in scripts:

	+ porgball: Support logging of tarballs from outside of current working
	  directory (thanks Piotr Karbowski).
	+ porgball: Don't crash when there's no logdir (thanks Piotr Karbowski).
	+ paco2porg: Properly lowercase package names (thanks Kardakov Slava).

	+ Display a startup info dialog when reading big databases.
	+ Added button "porg suffix" to the porgball creation dialog.
	+ When showing results in the "Find file" dialog, double clicking on a
	  row, or pressing of <Return>, makes the treeview in the main window 
	  scroll to the selected package.
	+ Improved the quality of the grop icon.

	Changes in scripts:

	+ Bugfix: porgball failed to process symbolic links to directories.
	+ Bugfix: paco2porg failed to process missing files.


Version 0.6 (16 June 2014)
--------------------------

	Changes in porg:

	+ Bugfix: porg erroniously complained about command line option
	  incompatibility when some options were doubled (like in '-rr').
	+ Improved the man page and usage output of porg, organizing options by
	  groups. Added a new section 'FILE NAMES WITH SPACES' to the man page. 
	  Reading it is recommended.
	+ Removed path /etc/mtab from the default EXCLUDE.
	+ Search package info in configure.log if config.log is not found.
	+ Ask the user when unlogging a package (option -U), unless option -b
	  is enabled.

	+ New icon.

	Changes in scripts:

	+ New command line options --no-porg-suffix and --logdir for porgball.
